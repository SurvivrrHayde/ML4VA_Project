# Educational Disparities Analysis in Virginia High Schools

## Introduction

This project embarks on a critical exploration of educational disparities among Virginia's high schools, employing K-means clustering to analyze data from the Department of Educationâ€™s School Quality Profiles. By examining various indicators such as funding, resource allocation, and academic outcomes, we aim to group high schools into clusters that reveal underlying patterns and correlations. These disparities, often shaped by geographical and socioeconomic factors, are scrutinized with the hope of furnishing policymakers, educators, and communities with actionable insights. Our ultimate goal is to foster a more equitable educational landscape in Virginia.
